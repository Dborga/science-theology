              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>In this exploration, I articulate why I personally reject Islam, primarily due to its foundational claims regarding the corruption of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. As someone deeply rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, I find these assertions particularly troubling. Islam posits that the Bible has undergone corruption—a claim that, from my perspective, is not adequately supported by evidence within Islamic teachings themselves. Furthermore, the presence of multiple translations of the Bible, aimed at bridging linguistic and cultural gaps across generations, does not, in my view, constitute corruption. This contrasts sharply with Islam's reward-based system of faith, where paradise is earned through deeds, diverging significantly from the Christian doctrine of grace, which teaches that salvation is a gift and not a result of human effort.</p>
              <p>My skepticism extends to the historical claims made by Islam, notably that Abraham constructed the Kaaba. This assertion is not corroborated by external historical sources and contradicts evidence linking the site to pre-Islamic pagan practices. The region was historically associated with the veneration of lunar deities, such as the goddess Al-Lat, who was worshiped in the form of a square stone. Additionally, the lack of a transparent explanation or mechanism within Islam to prevent the Quran from undergoing similar corruption raises substantial doubts about the consistency and reliability of its teachings.</p>
              <p>For this reason, I do not judge the characteristics of any deity based on the actions of their followers. Instead, I advocate for spiritual independence above all else.</p>

            <dt><strong>Revelation of the Quran</strong></dt>
                <dd>Prophet Muhammad, born in Mecca around 570 CE, is regarded as the final prophet in Islam. Muslims believe 
                    that Muhammad received revelations from God through the angel Gabriel over a period of approximately 23 years. 
                    These revelations began when Muhammad was meditating in the cave of Hira, near Mecca, and continued until his 
                    death in 632 CE. The messages he received were eventually compiled into the Quran</dd>
                    
                <dt><strong>Food for thought</strong></dt>
                <dd>In exploring the evolution of religious practices from pre-Islamic Arabia to the establishment of Islam, it's pivotal to delve into the theological transformation that occurred. Central to this transformation is the deity Hubal, a moon god worshipped at the Kaaba in Mecca, and how his worship potentially aligns with the later Islamic reverence for Allah. Historical accounts suggest that Hubal was the chief deity among the 360 idols revered at the Kaaba, which was also the site for the worship of other significant deities like Al-'Uzza, Al-Manat, and Al-Lat. These deities, often referred to as the daughters of Allah in pre-Islamic tradition, played a vital role in the religious rituals of the time, including the practice of circumambulation around the Kaaba—a ritual that continued into Islamic practices but solely in the worship of Allah.</dd>
                <br>
                <dd>The connection posited between Hubal and Allah is underpinned by the theory that the monotheistic shift led by Prophet Muhammad did not introduce a new god but rather redefined and consolidated the divine figurehead under the monotheistic banner of Islam. This narrative suggests a continuity rather than a break, asserting that the pre-Islamic moon worship influenced the theological framework of Islam. The shift from a polytheistic to a monotheistic worship structure, focusing on a singular, omnipotent God while repudiating the existence of other deities, marks a profound reorientation in the religious landscape of Arabia.</dd>

                <dt><strong>Major Deities and Worship Practices:</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Pre-Islamic Arab paganism was rich with deities, notably the goddesses Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat, often worshipped as a triple goddess. Hubal, associated with the moon, was another prominent deity. Rituals involved idol worship and veneration of stones and crystals. The Kaaba, now a central Islamic site, originally served as a major pagan shrine where rituals included topless circling, dancing, and singing praises to the goddesses.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Muhammad and the Three Goddesses:</strong></dt> 
                    <dd>The incident of the Satanic Verses, also known as the Gharaniq incident, refers to an episode in the life of Prophet Muhammad when he seemingly acknowledged the existence and intercessory power of three Meccan deities: Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. This occurred around 613 CE, during a time when Muhammad was trying to gain the acceptance of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca, who were initially resistant to his monotheistic message. According to various early Islamic sources, Muhammad was reciting Sura An-Najm (Chapter 53) when he reached verses 19 and 20: “Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?” It is said that Satan influenced Muhammad to continue with the words: “These are the exalted cranes (gharaniq), whose intercession is hoped for.” This statement pleased the Quraysh, as it appeared to recognize the divinity and intercessory power of their traditional deities​.</dd> 
                    <br>
                    <dd>The immediate reaction to this utterance was significant. The Quraysh, who had been hostile to Muhammad’s teachings, were reportedly pleased and accepted the proclamation. This led to a momentary reconciliation between Muhammad and the Quraysh, with reports stating that both Muslims and pagans prostrated together in a rare moment of unity. The incident of the Satanic Verses has been widely documented by early Islamic historians and biographers, including Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Hisham, and Al-Tabari. These accounts provide a detailed narrative of the event, though it remains controversial among Muslim scholars. Some later Islamic scholars and theologians have questioned the authenticity of the incident, arguing that it contradicts the infallibility of the Prophet.​</dd>

                <dt><strong>Jesus Christ</strong></dt>
                    <dd>In Islamic theology, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) holds a significant and revered position as one of the greatest prophets. The Quran presents a unique perspective on Jesus, distinguishing it from Christian teachings. According to the Quran, Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary (Maryam) through a miraculous birth, without a human father. This event is described in Surah Maryam (Chapter 19:16-21) and Surah Al-Imran (Chapter 3:45-47), where the angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will bear a son despite being a virgin. This miraculous birth underscores Jesus' unique and special status in Islamic theology.
                        <br>
                        <dd>Jesus is attributed with performing several miracles by the will of God (Allah). These include speaking as an infant, healing the blind and lepers, bringing the dead back to life, and creating a bird from clay. These acts are mentioned in Surah Al-Imran (Chapter 3:49) and Surah Al-Maidah (Chapter 5:110), highlighting his role as a powerful and divinely supported prophet. The Quran portrays Jesus as sinless and righteous. This sinless nature adds to his unique status among the prophets. Jesus is acknowledged as a prophet who brought the Injil (Gospel) to guide the Children of Israel. The Quran emphasizes his role in confirming the Torah that came before him and guiding his people with God's message (Surah Al-Maidah, 5:46).
                <dt><strong>Comparison with Muhammad</strong></dt>  
                    <dd>While both Jesus and Muhammad have miraculous aspects surrounding their births, Jesus' virgin birth is unparalleled and remains a profound miracle acknowledged in the Quran. In contrast, Muhammad was born through natural means to Abdullah and Amina. Jesus' miracles, performed from infancy and throughout his life, are numerous and dramatic. In comparison, Muhammad's primary miracle is considered the Quran itself, a revelation of unparalleled linguistic and spiritual depth.
                        <br>
                        <dd>The Quran suggests that Jesus will play a significant role in the judgment of the world upon his return (Surah An-Nisa, 4:159). This role is significant and unique, indicating a high status that can be interpreted as bearing characteristics typically associated with divinity.
                <dt><strong>Reflection and Conclusion</strong></dt>  
                            <dd>The Quran presents a profound and respectful view of Jesus, acknowledging his miraculous birth, his powerful miracles, and his sinlessness. Despite these attributes, which align closely with divine characteristics, the Quran positions Muhammad as the final and most significant prophet, tasked with delivering the ultimate revelation. Muslims often defend the uniqueness of Jesus' virgin birth by comparing it to the creation of Adam. They argue that just as Adam was created without parents, Jesus was born without a father (Surah Al-Imran, 3:59). However, this comparison has limitations. Adam's creation was unique as he was the first human, and there was no other way to bring the first human into existence. In contrast, Jesus' miraculous birth stands out because it occurred within the established natural order of human reproduction, making it a distinct and unparalleled event. Additionally, if Jesus is considered to have a divine aspect due to his virgin birth, it contradicts the characteristics of a normal prophet, positioning Jesus as a demigod, which challenges the strict monotheism of Islam.
