        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this page of my website, where I share my personal journey as someone of gentile ancestry seeking to be part of God's chosen nation, Israel. Let me clarify from the outset that when I speak of Israel, I do not refer to the modern political state bearing the "Star of David" on its flag. That star, with its pagan origins, does not represent King David nor the God of Israel. The Israel I aspire to join is the spiritual family—the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel.</p>

        <p>I believe that humanity's collective rebellion against God at the Tower of Babel, where all shared one language under a single king, led to God scattering the people into 70 different nations, each with its own language. Among these nations, God chose one for Himself, beginning with Abraham, while the others were given over to their idols. If your bloodline does not trace back to Jacob, then you are considered a gentile. However, through acceptance of Yeshua/Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you are adopted into this royal family, becoming a spiritual descendant of Jacob. Conversely, those who are physically descended from Jacob but rebel against the Lord can be cut off from this family.</p>
        <p>In this page, I will address various questions and topics related to Holy Scripture, sharing my understanding based on my studies and reflections. I want to emphasize that I do not claim to be an expert, nor do I believe anyone can truly be an expert on the Word of God. Credentials and titles mean little to me; I believe that God reveals His truth to those He chooses, not necessarily to those with academic accolades. If you are sincerely seeking to understand the God of Israel, I encourage you to read His Word and pray to Him. If your journey has brought you here, I am honored to play a small part in it, but always remember that our true teacher is the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>God is worshipped in spirit and in truth, which, in my view, means that our understanding of Scripture depends more on the sincerity of our hearts than on our intellectual achievements. With this in mind, I will begin by exploring what many consider to be one of the most controversial topics in Scripture, slavery.</p>

      <h1>FAQs of Holy Scripture</h1>
      <h2>Slavery</h2>
      <div align="center">
        <p>The Bible begins with a brief account of creation, followed by the narrative of humanity's fall and God's plan to restore order through a chosen family. Genesis concludes with members of this family rising to prominent positions in Egypt. Shortly after, the book of Exodus opens, and the entire Torah focuses on liberating this family from slavery in Egypt and guiding them to the Promised Land. The remainder of the Bible details the struggles and triumphs of this nation in relation to the Promised Land, particularly highlighting their disobedience to God.</p>
        <p>Given this overarching narrative, it is difficult to assume that the God of Israel, or the nation itself, endorses slavery. The first slaves mentioned in the Bible, before the introduction of the Law, are the Israelites themselves. This implies that if any nation understands the suffering and immorality of slavery, it is Israel, and likewise, their God, who witnessed the affliction of His chosen people. Therefore, why does the Bible, which is regarded as the Word of God, offer instructions on the treatment of slaves rather than outright condemning slavery? This has led some to conclude that the Bible condones slavery.</p>
        <p>Understanding the Bible’s stance on slavery requires approaching the text from its own perspective, rather than from a modern moral standpoint. Ephesians 6:12 reminds us that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
        <p>Slavery, from the very beginning, is depicted as a curse. When Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, they were subjected to a curse. When God, who spoke the world into existence, pronounces a curse, it becomes part of the reality we experience. The words of God are permanent, as He declares that heaven and earth may pass away, but His words will never pass away. This signifies that God is exceedingly careful with His speech; He does not speak lightly, for His words shape our reality without the possibility of retraction.</p>
        <p>Curses are often generational, affecting descendants for the sins of their ancestors, potentially leading them into slavery. This is evident in Genesis, where Noah curses Canaan, condemning his descendants to servitude. Similarly, in the book of Numbers, the Israelites were condemned to wander the wilderness for forty years due to the lack of faith shown by their parents in God's promise. The power of curses is further illustrated by the story of Balaam, a pagan sorcerer who was summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel. God intervened, instructing Balaam not to curse the Israelites. This narrative demonstrates that curses spoken by God are woven into the fabric of reality, activated by rituals to target those who are guilty.</p>
        <h3>Exodus 21:20-21</h3>
        <p>“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.”</p>
        <p>Many interpret this passage as an endorsement of slave masters beating their slaves. However, the Bible allowed such actions the moment humanity began to define good and evil for itself, even before slavery existed. God does not interfere with human free will; if one chooses to act wickedly, God’s role is to judge and punish that individual at the appointed time, not to prevent the evil act. The only time God intervenes is when an individual consents to align their free will with God's will. In such a case, a covenant is formed, and that person’s struggles become God’s concerns. Even a slave can rise to a position of great authority, as seen in the story of Joseph, who ascended to second-in-command in Egypt, or David, a shepherd boy who became king of Israel. Life involves struggles because God is the author of the grand narrative, telling a story through the world and each individual. Thus, even if one chooses to be evil, God can use such individuals as part of His divine narrative. Critics who question God's allowance of evil often fail to see the broader context, much like how they enjoy movies with complex plots, villains, and conflicts. Yet, when God uses such elements in His story, they label it as immoral, overlooking their praise for human authors who create similar narratives filled with challenges and antagonists.</p>
        <p>The laws in Exodus, such as those in Exodus 21:20, often address hypothetical worst-case scenarios, reflecting the weakness and selfishness of humanity and the effects of the curse. For example, domestic violence, which is prevalent even today, illustrates how people can be prone to violence, not just against slaves, but against loved ones such as spouses. These are the principalities warned about in Ephesians 6:12. Often, domestic violence is fueled by alcohol, drugs, anger, jealousy, and other negative influences, which can include addictions to pornography, violent video games, or unhealthy attachments to various forms of entertainment. The Bible mentions a spirit of jealousy, suggesting the existence of spirits of anger and other emotions. Feeling emotions is normal, but losing control to them makes a person vulnerable to these spirits, posing a threat to others physically or emotionally. If these spirits can drive a man to beat his wife and children, one can only imagine what such a person might do to a slave.</p>
        <p>Immediately executing someone based on a desire for vengeance or to satisfy anger can exacerbate the situation. Such an act can make one a victim of the spirit of anger, bringing curses upon oneself and one's descendants, potentially leading to further exile and enslavement of Israel. These laws are intended to be practiced within the context of a unified Israel, not while the people are scattered among other nations during exile.</p>
        <p>One might ask, "If that’s the case, why does God give a clear law in Leviticus 25:39 stating that Israelites should not be owned as slaves by their fellow Israelites?" This is an excellent question. The reason is that an Israelite cannot be a slave to his own people because it would contradict their covenantal relationship with God. When Israel is united as one nation under one God, they are blessed, and no individual is subjected to the curse of slavery. If a person sins, the law prescribes appropriate consequences: depending on the sin, the individual could be put to death, have their sin atoned for through sacrifice, or suffer a temporary plague. This does not imply that Israel is immune to slavery. When Israel is enslaved, it signifies that the entire nation is under a curse, a curse often carried out by foreign nations such as the Babylonians and Assyrians—nations that triumph over Israel whenever they are in exile. This is clearly stated by God in the following chapter, Leviticus 26:14-46. It is important to remember that God’s words cannot be undone, only avoided through the acknowledgment of sin and sincere repentance. Breaking the covenant with God is a grave matter, for the sword that avenges such transgressions is truly terrifying.</p>
        <p>Thus, God cannot simply eliminate slavery; He provides guidance for navigating it. While our modern morals may struggle with some aspects of this process, particularly in the context of our current mindset, it remains the best way to address the issue without exacerbating it. This situation is a consequence of humanity defining good and evil for itself, driven by lust and emotions.</p>
        <h2>Is Yeshua God?</h2>
        <p>When considering the question of Yeshua's divinity, John 8:58 provides a profound and straightforward assertion where Yeshua declares, "Before Abraham was, I am." This statement directly aligns with the characteristics of God as revealed in the Old Testament, specifically referencing the divine name "I Am" (Exodus 3:14), which God used when speaking to Moses. For those familiar with the nature of God in the Old Testament, Yeshua's declaration should be sufficient to recognize that He is claiming to be the God of Israel. However, it's important to acknowledge that numerous scholars have proposed alternative interpretations of this verse, attempting to shift its meaning away from its clear and direct implications. My aim here is to share why it is evident to me that Yeshua is indeed God, beginning with an examination of the names of the first ten patriarchs in Genesis.</p>
        <p>Adam...Man</p> 
        <p>Seth...Appointed</p>
        <p>Enosh...Mortal</p>
        <p>Cainan...Sorrow</p>
        <p>Mahalalel...The Blessed God</p>
        <p>Jared...Shall come down</p>
        <p>Enoch...Teaching</p>
        <p>Methuselah...His death shall bring</p>
        <p>Lamech...The desparing</p>
        <p>Noah...Comfort or Rest</p>
        <p>Man appointed mortal, sorrow, but the Blessed God shall come down, teaching, His death shall bring the despairing comfort or rest.</p>
        <p>In the genealogical record from Adam to Noah, the meanings of their names, when taken together, form a message that foreshadows God's plan for humanity. This connection between the names of the patriarchs and the overarching narrative of Scripture is one of the clues that led me to recognize Yeshua's divinity.</p>
        <p>Another significant clue is found in Numbers 20:12. Here, God tells Moses that he will not bring Israel into the Promised Land because he disobeyed God's command to speak to the rock to bring forth water. Instead, Moses struck the rock, acting as though he was the one causing the water to flow, rather than God. This moment of disobedience was seen as Moses placing himself in the position of God, which led to his punishment. Similarly, in 1 Chronicles 21:1, we see King David numbering Israel, despite a clear command in Exodus 30:12 that Israel, as God's possession, should not be counted unless God Himself commands it. In ancient cultures, a man could only count what belonged to him, and since Israel belonged to God, David's action was viewed as placing himself in God's role, leading to his punishment as well.</p>
        <p>If such subtle claims to God's authority by Moses and David warranted immediate divine correction, consider the claims made by Yeshua, which are far more direct. For instance, Yeshua declares, "I am the Light of the World" (John 8:12), "I am" (John 8:58, 18:5-6), "I came for my sheep" (John 10:14-16; Matthew 15:24), "I am the Truth" (John 14:6), "I forgive sin" (Mark 2:5-7; Luke 7:48-50), "Come to Me" (Matthew 11:28-30), and "He who comes to Me will never thirst" (John 6:35; 4:14). These statements are significant because they not only assert Yeshua's divine identity but also show that He is fulfilling roles and responsibilities that the Old Testament attributes exclusively to God.</p>
        <p>For example, in John 8:12, Yeshua claims to be "the Light of the World," a title that reflects God's role as the source of spiritual illumination and truth. In John 8:58, He uses the divine name "I Am," echoing God's self-identification to Moses in the burning bush. This claim is so powerful that in John 18:5-6, when Yeshua speaks the words "I am he," those who came to arrest Him physically draw back and fall to the ground, overwhelmed by the divine presence.</p>
        <p>Yeshua further identifies Himself as "the Good Shepherd" in John 10:14-16, a role that the Old Testament ascribes to God as the Shepherd of Israel. He also states in Matthew 15:24 that He was "sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," underscoring His mission to gather God's people.</p>
        <p>In John 14:6, Yeshua makes the bold declaration, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Here, Yeshua is claiming to be the exclusive path to God, the embodiment of truth, and the giver of life—attributes that belong solely to God.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most striking is Yeshua's authority to forgive sins, as seen in Mark 2:5-7 and Luke 7:48-50. The scribes and those present recognize that only God can forgive sins, yet Yeshua does so with authority, demonstrating His divine prerogative.</p>
        <p>Yeshua also invites those who are weary and burdened to come to Him for rest (Matthew 11:28-30), promising to give them rest for their souls—a promise that echoes God's invitation to find rest in Him. Similarly, in John 6:35 and 4:14, Yeshua offers Himself as the "bread of life" and the source of "living water," satisfying the deepest spiritual needs of humanity. Moreover, Yeshua speaks of Israel as His own in Matthew 21:43 and John 1:11, affirming His authority over the people of God and the kingdom of God.</p>
        <p>Finally, additional verses such as John 10:27-28 and John 14:1-3 reinforce Yeshua's divine identity. In John 10:27-28, Yeshua claims to give eternal life to His followers, ensuring that they will never perish—a promise that only God can make. In John 14:1-3, Yeshua speaks of preparing a place for His followers in His Father's house, where He will come again and take them to Himself, highlighting His role in the eternal destiny of believers.</p>
        <p>In summary, Yeshua's claims are not mere words but are backed by actions and titles that the Old Testament reserves for God alone. When examined in light of Scripture, it becomes clear that Yeshua is indeed claiming to be the God of Israel. While others may offer alternative interpretations, for me, these passages unmistakably reveal Yeshua's divine nature.</p>
