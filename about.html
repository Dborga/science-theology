    <h4>My personal take on religion in general:</h4>
    <p>
I do not subscribe to the concept of a "false religion." In my view, such a notion does not exist. Every religion has an entity behind its practices, and if one adheres to the specific rules and rituals, it is possible to gain favor in the eyes of the deity associated with that religion. This deity may have the power to bring about positive changes in one's life. However, depending on their character, they may also choose to ignore you.

When it comes to religion, I do not concern myself with the behavior or practices of its adherents while seeking a deity to follow. I firmly believe that no one in this world truly knows how to represent their god or practice correctly. Humanity, in my view, often leads lives that contradict their beliefs or what they profess to follow, revealing a pervasive self-interest and inconsistency.

For this reason, I do not judge the characteristics of any deity based on the actions of their followers. Instead, I advocate for spiritual independence above all else.
